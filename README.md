FallGameJam 2017 
Theme: Can't Stop Me Now by Queen
Project developed over the course of one weekend for a gamejam hosted by the Video Game Developement Club at University of California Irvine.
In this two player game, player two aims to stop player one by placing obstacles (walls, caves, and pits) while player one changes size to avoid them.
